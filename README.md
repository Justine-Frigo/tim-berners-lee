# Website about Tim Berners-Lee

## Project

This project is an extra challenge provided by BeCode. I had to do my first integration (using HTML and CSS) based on an image and some assets I've been given to work with.
Thanks to this project, I've been able to get my hands on flexboxes for the first time, which was not easy at first.
You can have a look at the published version here :
